# Creating-a-Heat-map-on-the-basis-of-Traffic-congestion
Created a heat map of an intersection in Ludhiana, Punjab, using XML traffic data and osm map 
Using the HERE Maps API, we were able to extract real-time traffic speed data for a specific area of interest. The API provided us with a JSON response containing the current speed on different road segments, as well as information on traffic incidents and road closures. We then parsed the JSON data and used it to plot the traffic speed on a map using the HERE Maps JavaScript library. The resulting map displayed different colors to indicate the traffic speed on each road segment, with red indicating heavy traffic and green indicating smooth flow. This allowed us to quickly and easily visualize the traffic conditions in the area and make informed decisions
